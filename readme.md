# ABCmint block explorer deployment script
### A block explorer created for ABCMint. Uses [iquidus block explorer.](https://github.com/iquidus/explorer)

By default, iquidus will run on port 3001. 

If installing locally, I highly recommend doing it in a virtualized environment.

Please make sure to tweak the settings in config/ if you plan on running the server to the public.

__Usage:__ 

1) Mark install and dependencies as executable, by running the command
        
        chmod +x install.sh dependencies.sh 
2) Run the installer executable
        
        ./install.sh
3) Follow the on-screen prompts
